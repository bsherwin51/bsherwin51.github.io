								<u><b>Education:</b></u>
								<br>
								Stanford University <br>
								&emsp; &emsp; PhD in Physics (expected 2029) <br>
								&emsp; &emsp; NSF Graduate Research Fellow <br>
								University of Florida <br>
								&emsp; &emsp; Bachelor of Science in Physics, Astrophysics, and Mathematics (2024)<br>
								&emsp; &emsp; GPA: 3.98/4.0
							</p>
							<p>
								<u><b>Research Interests: </b> </u>
								<br> Broadly speaking, I am interested in theoretical and observational cosmology. 
								My primary focus is combining information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (early Universe) with surveys of large-scale structure (late Universe).
								I am a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration.

								<u><b>About Me: </b> </u>
								<br>
								I am a Florida native, and was born and raised in Tampa, FL. After graduating high school, my identical twin brother and I moved to Gainesville, FL and attended the University of Florida (Go Gators!). 
								At UF, I was a Platinum Presidential Scholar, triple majored in physics, astrophysics, mathematics, and minored in theater. 
								My interest in cosmology formed by researching higher-order statistics for galaxy clustering with Prof. Zack Slepian at UF and spending a summer researching reionization with Prof. John Wise at Georgia Tech.
								Following my graduation at UF in 2024, I traveled across the country to the other "Bay Area" to attend Stanford University, where I am now working towards my PhD in Physics. 
								I am proud to be a member of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC), which I think is the greatest place in the world to be doing astrophysics (I'm not biased!).
								Outside of work, I love watching the latest movies in theaters, seeing musicals and plays, exploring San Francisco, and solving crossword puzzles. 
								My go-to fun fact is that not only am I a twin, but both my parents are too!

								<u><b>Photometric Redshift Requirements for CMB Lensing x Lyman Break Galaxies</b></u>
								<br>
								 LSST has very strict requirements for photo-z calibration at low redshifts because decades of work have led to very good constraints and modeling at low redshifts. 
								 Higher-redshift cosmology is relatively unconstrained, however, and we can likely still get very interesting science out with relaxed photo-z calibration. 
								 Just how much we can relax our photo-z requirements is still unknown. 
								 The answer to this question will be very impactful for planning out future Lyman Break Galaxies analyses with LSST.

								<u><b>Modified 3x2 Point Analysis</b></u>
								<br>
								The standard 3×2 point analysis combines galaxies into broad lens and source samples and correlates each possible combination of samples (lens-lens, lens-source, source-source).
								By instead splitting galaxies by properties like color or luminosity before the 3×2 analysis, we may break degeneracies and gain extra constraining power.
								Testing how much this improves cosmological information will help guide future LSST large-scale structure analyses.
